Hello! And welcome to the Flying Monkeys' Fantastic Falling Fan Trivia Game.

Here, the council of monkeys will ask you questions, which will determine whether they choose to lift you away save you from your plummeting fate.

"Question One!" announces the elder monkey, as they carefully inspect a peel of banana for anything that might be left edible.\n\n

...Only now do you notice the immense amount of banananasPiled around you on this falling stone platform.. The bananananasSeem to be used for everything, from the obvious food source to building materials to tooth brushes to toys to even glasses, but you can't imagine how well one could see through a pair of K-Vision goggles.\n\n

One such monkey wearing these goggles hobbles up to you now, carrying a pile of limp banananananasSkins and a bananananananaPointPen. As this monkey hands you these materials, the black ends of the banananananananas(Where eyes might ought to go?) seem to peer into your soul, as though they know everything and more that there is to know about you, and they are very, very deeply conflicted about you due to a familial disagreement back in the chain... "Disgrace to our fine culture," you think you hear, but so soft that it could have just been the wind.  The monkey moves in closer and closer, so close that it could, and actually does bump into you, obviously unaware of where you are due to some odd oblong fruit obscuring its vision.\n\n

"WRITE DOWN YOUR AGE," speaks the elder monkey.

  "Too young!" screeches the Grand Council of Flying Monkeys.  You watch as their leathery wings unfold around you, casting a shadow that seems all-encompassing, as though they intend to devour the world.  The take of, the chorus of their wings beating with such intensity that you're forced down to your knees to bear the sheer force of the wind coming down upon you. You look up at the monkeys, one last time, your eyes welling up with tears in a futile attempt to fight the wind.  You see the monkeys preparing their bananananananananaGuns to fire their banananananananananaShells.  You hear someone laughing somewhere behind you, but before you can turn to look, the bananaSplits.
